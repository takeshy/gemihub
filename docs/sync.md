# Sync

Manual push/pull synchronization between the browser (IndexedDB) and Google Drive.

## Features

- **Manual Sync**: Push and pull changes when you want
- **Offline-First**: Files are cached in IndexedDB for instant access
- **Soft Delete**: Deleted files are moved to a `trash/` folder on Drive (recoverable)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Choose local or remote version with automatic backup
- **Full Push / Full Pull**: Bulk sync for initial setup or recovery
- **Untracked File Management**: Detect, restore, or delete orphaned remote files
- **Trash & Conflict Backup Management**: Restore or permanently delete trashed files and conflict backups

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Push** | Upload local changes (incremental) |
| **Pull** | Download remote changes (incremental) |
| **Full Push** | Upload all modified files + merge metadata into remote |
| **Full Pull** | Download entire remote vault (skip matching hashes) |

Header buttons: Push and Pull buttons are always visible. Badge shows count of pending changes.
- **Push Badge**: Count of locally modified files, excluding system/history files and files whose content was reverted to the synced state (no net change).
- **Pull Badge**: Count of pending remote work — updates to already-cached files (`toPull`), conflicts, and files deleted on remote (`localOnly`). Brand-new remote files are **not** counted here; they are auto-registered as uncached entries during background polling and surface directly in the file tree.
- **Nature of Change**: Clicking a badge shows a file list with icons indicating the change type:
  - <kbd>✎</kbd> (Blue): Modified file
  - <kbd>🗑</kbd> (Red): Deleted on remote

## How Sync Works

### Overview

The system tracks file states using metadata:
- **Local Meta**: Stored in IndexedDB (`syncMeta` store, key `"current"`)
- **Remote Meta**: `_sync-meta.json` file on Google Drive

Each metadata contains:
- `lastUpdatedAt`: Timestamp of last sync
- `files`: MD5 checksum and modification time for each file (keyed by file ID)

File contents are cached in the IndexedDB `files` store. All edits update this cache directly (no Drive API call). The MD5 checksum in the metadata is only updated during sync operations (Push/Pull) and file reads — it reflects the last-synced state, not the current local content. Local modifications are tracked separately via the `editHistory` store.

### Background Polling

The client polls for remote changes every 5 minutes while the app is active and idle. When a fresh `_sync-meta.json` is fetched:

1. **Cached remote meta is refreshed** (preserving any local-only `new:` entries).
2. **New remote files are auto-registered** into local sync meta as metadata-only (uncached) entries. The tree picks them up on the next `tree-meta-updated` event; content is fetched lazily the first time the user opens the file. This is what keeps the Pull badge from inflating just because another device added files.
3. **A toast is shown** ("N new file(s) on Drive") whenever new entries are auto-registered and a prior sync exists. This surfaces additions that would otherwise be hidden deep in the tree. First-ever fetches skip the toast since every file would otherwise qualify as "new".
4. **`tree-meta-updated` is dispatched** when either the remote meta's `lastUpdatedAt` changed or new entries were registered, so remote-side renames/deletions/additions appear without requiring a manual Pull.
5. **Pull / Push counts are recomputed.**

### Sync Diff

The diff algorithm compares two metadata snapshots plus a set of locally edited file IDs:

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Local Meta** | Client's last-synced snapshot (IndexedDB) |
| **Remote Meta** | Server's current snapshot (`_sync-meta.json`, read-only during diff) |
| **locallyModifiedFileIds** | File IDs from IndexedDB `editHistory` (tracks local edits) |

Detection logic per file:

| Local Changed | Remote Changed | Result |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|--------|
| No | No | Skip (unchanged) |
| Yes | No | **toPush** |
| No | Yes | **toPull** |
| Yes | Yes | **Conflict** |
| Local only | - | **localOnly** (Remotely deleted) |
| - | Remote only | **remoteOnly** (New remote) |

Where:
- `localChanged = locallyModifiedFileIds.has(fileId)` — the `editHistory` store tracks which files have been edited locally since the last sync
- `remoteChanged = localMeta.md5Checksum !== remoteMeta.md5Checksum || localMeta.name !== remoteMeta.name` — remote meta diverges from local meta when another device has pushed changes (detects both content and name changes)

No live Drive API listing is needed: the `drive.file` scope ensures only GemiHub can modify these files, so `_sync-meta.json` is always authoritative.

---

## Push Changes (Incremental)

Uploads locally-changed files to remote.

### Flow

```
1. PRE-CHECK: Diff check before writing anything
   ├─ Read LocalSyncMeta from IndexedDB (may be null on first sync)
   ├─ GET /api/sync → { remoteMeta, syncMetaFileId }
   │   └─ Server: find + read _sync-meta.json, return meta and its file ID
   ├─ Compute diff client-side (localMeta vs remoteMeta + locallyModifiedFileIds)
   └─ Remote has blocking changes (conflicts, edit-delete conflicts, toPull, or remote-deleted entries still in local meta) → error "Pull first". Pure new remote files (`remoteOnly`) do not block push.

2. BATCH UPLOAD: Update all files via single API call
   ├─ Get modified file IDs from IndexedDB editHistory
   ├─ Filter to only files tracked in any known meta (remoteMeta or localMeta)
   ├─ Filter out system files and excluded paths (history/, plugins/, etc.)
   ├─ Include binary files (base64-encoded) with encoding flag (skip hasNetContentChange)
   ├─ Filter out reverted text files (hasNetContentChange = false)
   ├─ Read all modified file contents from IndexedDB cache
   ├─ POST /api/sync { action: "pushFiles", files, remoteMeta, syncMetaFileId }
   │   └─ Server:
   │       ├─ Use client-provided remoteMeta (skip re-reading _sync-meta.json)
   │       ├─ For each file (parallel, max 5 concurrent):
   │       │   ├─ Read old content from Drive (for edit history)
   │       │   ├─ Skip upload if content is identical to remote (optimization)
   │       │   └─ Update file on Drive
   │       ├─ Write _sync-meta.json once via syncMetaFileId (skip findFileByExactName)
   │       ├─ Save remote edit history in background (best-effort)
   │       └─ Return results + updated remoteMeta
   ├─ Update IndexedDB cache with new md5/modifiedTime
   └─ Update LocalSyncMeta directly from returned remoteMeta

3. CLEANUP
   ├─ Clear IndexedDB editHistory for pushed files only
   ├─ Clear IndexedDB editHistory for reverted files (no net change)
   ├─ Update localModifiedCount
   └─ Fire "sync-complete" event (UI refresh)

4. RAG (background, non-blocking)
   ├─ Register eligible files in RAG store
   │   └─ Failures recorded as "pending" in RAG tracking meta
   ├─ Save RAG tracking info
   └─ Retry previously pending RAG registrations
```

### Preconditions

| Local Meta | Remote Meta | Remote Newer | Action |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|--------|
| - | - | - | Nothing to push |
| - | exists | - | Nothing to push |
| any | any | Yes (with pending pulls) | Error: "Pull required" |
| any | any | No | Proceed with Push |

### Important Notes

- Push checks for conflicts and remote-newer **before** writing any files to Drive. If the check fails, nothing is written.
- Push does **NOT** delete remote files. Deletion is handled separately (see Soft Delete below).
- After a successful push, local edit history in IndexedDB is cleared for the pushed files and for reverted files (files whose content was edited then reverted to the synced state).

---

## Pull Changes (Incremental)

Downloads remotely-changed files to local cache. Brand-new remote files are registered as metadata-only (uncached) entries and are fetched lazily when opened.

### Flow

1. **Compute diff** using local meta vs remote meta (with `locallyModifiedFileIds`)
2. **Check conflicts** — if any, stop and show conflict UI
3. **Clean up `localOnly` files** — files that exist locally but were deleted on remote (moved to trash on another device) are removed from IndexedDB cache, edit history, and local sync meta
4. **Combine** `toPull` + `remoteOnly` arrays
5. **Skip download for uncached-by-design entries**: `remoteOnly` (new remote files), binary files on mobile, and files larger than 100 MB. Their metadata is still written to local sync meta so the tree displays them.
6. **Download remaining files** in parallel (max 5 concurrent)
7. **Update IndexedDB cache** with downloaded files (for text files, `addCommitBoundary` is called before updating to preserve edit history session boundaries)
8. **Update local sync meta** with new checksums
9. **Fire "sync-complete" and "files-pulled" events** and update localModifiedCount

### Decision Tables

#### Files in Both Metas

| Local Meta | Remote Meta | Action |
|:----------:|:-----------:|--------|
| A | A | Skip (unchanged) |
| B | A | Skip (local-only change, uploads on next Push) |
| A | B | **Download** (remote changed) |
| B | C | **Conflict** (both changed) |

#### Files Only in Local Meta (Remote Deleted)

| Local Meta | Remote Meta | Action |
|:----------:|:-----------:|--------|
| A | - | **localOnly** → Remove from local cache (remote deletion synced) |

#### Files Only in Remote (New Remote)

| Local Meta | Remote Meta | Action |
|:----------:|:-----------:|--------|
| - | A | **remoteOnly** → Register metadata only (uncached); content fetched on first open |

---

## Lazy-Fetch (Uncached Files)

A file is **uncached** when its metadata is tracked in local sync meta but no entry exists in the IndexedDB `files` store. Three paths produce uncached entries:

| Source | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Background polling auto-register | New remote files discovered between syncs |
| Incremental Pull | `remoteOnly` entries from the diff |
| Mobile / large-file skip | Binary files on mobile, files over 100 MB |

When the user opens an uncached file, `useFileWithCache` fetches the content from Drive, writes it into the cache, and dispatches a `file-cached` event that the file tree uses to update its indicator. No additional sync work is required.

### Bulk Caching

Uncached files can be downloaded on demand without waiting for first-open:

- **Folder right-click → "Cache folder (N)"**: Caches every uncached file under the selected folder (`new:` placeholders excluded). Only shown when uncached files exist in that subtree.
- **FILES header → Cache icon**: Caches every uncached file in the workspace. Disabled when all files are already cached or a bulk cache is in progress; the tooltip shows the pending count or current progress.

Both paths route through `useSync.cacheFilesByIds`, which chunks the IDs (200 per request), calls the `pullDirect` API, and writes each response into the cache. `cachingProgress` is exposed on the hook for UI feedback and the shared sync lock prevents concurrent bulk operations.

---

## Full Pull

Downloads all remote files, skipping those with matching hashes.

### Flow

1. **Build `skipHashes`** from all IndexedDB cached files (`fileId → md5Checksum`)
2. **Rebuild remote meta** from Drive API (full scan)
3. **Filter out** system files (`_sync-meta.json`, `settings.json`)
4. **Skip** files where `skipHashes[fileId] === remoteMeta.md5Checksum`
5. **Download** all non-skipped files in parallel (max 5 concurrent)
6. **Update IndexedDB cache** with downloaded files
7. **Delete stale cache** — remove cached files that no longer exist on remote
8. **Clear all local edit history** (remote is authoritative)
9. **Replace local sync meta** entirely with remote meta
10. **Fire "sync-complete" event** and update localModifiedCount

### When to Use

- Initial setup on a new device/browser
- Recovery after cache corruption
- When you want remote to be authoritative

---

## Full Push

Uploads all locally modified files directly to Drive and merges metadata. **This is a destructive operation** — it does not check for conflicts or remote changes before overwriting. Remote files will be overwritten without warning.

### Flow

1. **Batch upload** — all modified files are sent in a single `pushFiles` API call; server updates Drive files in parallel (max 5 concurrent), reads/writes `_sync-meta.json` once, and saves remote edit history in background
2. **Update IndexedDB** — cache and LocalSyncMeta updated with new md5/modifiedTime from server response
3. **Clear edit history** — if all eligible files were pushed, clear all edit history; otherwise clear per-file for successfully pushed files only
4. **Fire "sync-complete" event** and update localModifiedCount
5. **RAG registration (background)** — register eligible files, save tracking info, retry pending registrations

### When to Use

- Force remote metadata to match local state
- After bulk local edits that bypassed normal sync
- **Caution:** Unlike incremental Push, Full Push skips conflict detection and may overwrite remote changes made on other devices

---

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts occur during Push or Pull when both local and remote versions of a file have changed since the last sync.

| Choice | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| **Keep Local** | Back up remote to `sync_conflicts/`, upload local content to Drive, update remote meta |
| **Keep Remote** | Back up local to `sync_conflicts/`, download remote content to IndexedDB |

After resolution:
- The resolved file's edit history entry is cleared
- Local sync meta is partially merged — only the resolved file's entry is updated from the server's remote meta (other remote changes are not applied until the next Pull)
- localModifiedCount is updated

The unselected version is always backed up for manual merging if needed.

### Backup Naming

```
{filename}_{YYYYMMDD_HHmmss}.{ext}
```

Example: `notes/daily.md` → `sync_conflicts/notes_daily_20260207_143000.md`

---

## Soft Delete (Trash)

File deletion uses a soft delete model. Deleted files are moved to a `trash/` subfolder on Google Drive instead of being permanently destroyed.

### Flow

1. User deletes a file (context menu → Trash)
2. Server moves the file to `trash/` subfolder via Drive API (`moveFile`)
3. File is removed from `_sync-meta.json`
4. Local caches (IndexedDB file cache) are cleaned up
5. File tree updates to reflect the removal

### Cross-Device Sync

When a file is deleted on one device:
- The file is moved to `trash/` and removed from remote sync meta
- Other devices detect it as `localOnly` during their next Pull
- Pull automatically removes the file from their local cache

### Recovery

Trashed files can be managed from Settings → Sync → Trash:
- **Restore**: Moves the file back from `trash/` to the root folder and re-adds it to sync meta
- **Permanently Delete**: Removes the file from Drive entirely (irreversible)

---

## Temporary Sync

Quick file sharing without full sync overhead. Use when:
- You want to quickly share a single file across devices
- You need a backup before making risky edits
- You want to preserve specific files across a Pull (see tip below)

Files are stored with `__TEMP__/` prefix on Google Drive. **No metadata is updated** — equivalent to making the same edit on both devices manually.

Temp files can be managed from Settings → Sync → Temporary Files.

### Edit URL

After "Temp UP" saves the file, a confirmation dialog asks whether to generate an edit URL. If confirmed, the URL is copied to the clipboard. The edit URL allows editing the file from other apps (valid for 1 hour).

### Preserving Files Across a Pull

If you have local files that you don't want overwritten by a Pull, you can use Temp UP / Temp DL as a workaround:

1. **Before Pull**: Click "Temp UP" on the files you want to preserve
2. **Pull**: Perform the Pull — remote versions will overwrite local cache
3. **After Pull**: Click "Temp DL" on those files to restore your saved versions

## Chat-Initiated File Operations

When Gemini AI uses `update_drive_file` or `create_drive_file` tools in chat, file operations follow a local-first pattern to stay consistent with push/pull sync.

### update_drive_file (Local-First)

The server does **not** write to Drive. Instead, it reads file metadata only and returns the new content to the client via an SSE `drive_file_updated` chunk.

```
Chat → Server (getFileMetadata only, no Drive write)
     → SSE: drive_file_updated { fileId, fileName, content }
     → Client:
         1. addCommitBoundary(fileId)         — separate previous session
         2. saveLocalEdit(fileId, content)     — record diff in editHistory
         3. setCachedFile(content, old md5)    — update cache, keep last-synced md5
         4. addCommitBoundary(fileId)          — isolate chat edit as own session
         5. dispatch "file-modified"           — update sync badge count
         6. dispatch "file-restored"           — refresh editor if file is open
```

**Sync behavior after update:**
- `localMeta.md5` = old value (unchanged), `remoteMeta.md5` = old value (Drive untouched)
- `editHistory` has the fileId → `locallyModifiedFileIds` includes it
- Diff result: `localChanged = true`, `remoteChanged = false` → **toPush**
- Normal push uploads the new content to Drive

### create_drive_file (Drive + Local Seed)

The server creates the file on Drive (an ID is needed) and returns content + metadata via an SSE `drive_file_created` chunk.

```
Chat → Server (createFile on Drive + upsertFileInMeta)
     → SSE: drive_file_created { fileId, fileName, content, md5Checksum, modifiedTime }
     → Client:
         1. setCachedFile(content, Drive md5)  — seed cache with Drive checksum
         2. setLocalSyncMeta(fileId, Drive md5) — local meta matches remote
         3. dispatch "sync-complete"            — refresh file tree
```

**Sync behavior after create:**
- `localMeta.md5` = Drive value, `remoteMeta.md5` = same Drive value
- Diff result: `localChanged = false`, `remoteChanged = false` → **already synced**
- No push needed

---

## File Recovery

### Scenario 1: Conflict — Need Both Versions

When a conflict occurs, you choose Keep Local or Keep Remote, but the other version is always saved to `sync_conflicts/`.

**To merge manually:**
1. Settings → Sync → Conflict Backups → Manage
2. Select the backup file, edit the restore name if needed
3. Click Restore — the backup is created as a new file in the root folder

### Scenario 2: Recover a Deleted File

Deleted files are moved to the `trash/` folder on Google Drive.

**To recover:**
1. Settings → Sync → Trash → Manage
2. Select the file you need
3. Click Restore — the file is moved back to the root folder and re-tracked

### Scenario 3: Restore from Remote

If you accidentally changed or deleted files locally and want to restore from remote.

**To recover:** Use **Full Pull** — this downloads all remote files, skipping only those with matching hashes. Your local cache is replaced entirely, stale cache files are deleted, and all local edit history is cleared.

## Settings

Located in Settings → Sync tab, organized into sections:

### Sync Status
- Last synced timestamp

### Data Management
| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Manage Temp Files | Browse and manage temporary files on Drive |
| Detect Untracked Files | Find remote files not tracked in local cache |
| Trash | Restore or permanently delete trashed files |
| Conflict Backups | Manage conflict backup files from sync resolution |

### Edit History
| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Prune | Remove old edit history entries to free storage |
| Stats | View edit history storage usage and entry counts |

### Danger Zone
| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Full Push | Upload all modified files and merge metadata (overwrites remote) |
| Full Pull | Download all remote files (overwrites local cache) |

### System Files & Folders (Always Excluded from Sync)

Excluded by name filter in `computeSyncDiff`:
- `_sync-meta.json` — Sync metadata
- `settings.json` — User settings
- `_encrypted-auth.json` — Encrypted authentication data

Excluded by folder structure — these are actual Google Drive subfolders created via `ensureSubFolder()`. Files inside subfolders are not returned by `listUserFiles(rootFolderId)`. As a safety net, `isSyncExcludedPath()` also filters these prefixes on the client side:
- `history/` — Chat, execution, and request history (including `_meta.json` and `.history.json` files)
- `trash/` — Soft-deleted files (managed via Trash dialog)
- `sync_conflicts/` — Conflict backup files (managed via Conflict Backups dialog)
- `__TEMP__/` — Temporary sync files (managed via Temp Files dialog)
- `plugins/` — Installed plugin files
